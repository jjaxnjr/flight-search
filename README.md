# flight-search

Here is the results of the code challenge.
* I used ASP.NET MVC 5 and Web API 2 on .NET 4.6.1.
* The client side uses Angular 4.
* The server side was approached with TDD.
* The client side was my first time using Typescript and Angular 4 so I didn't write unit tests there to save one some time.
* All three required components for Selecting, Searching, and Sorting results are implemented.
* The two extra credit components are also included.

Tools I added to the project:
* AutoMapper
* Unity
  * Unity.MVC5
  * Unity.WebAPI
* Moq
* CsvHelper
* Angular2 with TypeScript

Ohter things I would do to make this fully production ready:
* Add Client Side Unit Tests
* Add Logging using Log4Net
* Add more comments
